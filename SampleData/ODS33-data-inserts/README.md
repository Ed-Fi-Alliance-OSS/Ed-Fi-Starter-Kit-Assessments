# ODS 3.3 data insertion

This starter kit uses GrandBend data to show info using PowerBI file dashboard.
This database has a lack of data on some very specific areas. With this script we try to solve this  problem by inserting some records.
This script insert extra student information to provide a better visualization of the data rendering using this dashboard.

Using powershell run this command to start this process:
```bash
.\data_insert.ps1
```
*You can change the name of the Server Instance and the objective Database name inside the script before running it.*
