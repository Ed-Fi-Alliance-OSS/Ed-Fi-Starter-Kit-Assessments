# Ed-Fi-Starter-Kit-Assessments

This starter kit uses Grandbend database. This database has a lack of data on some very specific areas. With this script we try to sovle this  problem by inserting some records.

More specifically we need to create some assessments where its reporting method is equal to 'Scale Score' and more assessments where its reporting method is 'Achievement/proficiency level'.

Additionally we need to create some student assessment grades where the assessment granding period is equal to 'First Nine Weeks', 'Second Nine Weeks', 'Third Nine Weeks', 'Fourth Nine Weeks', 'First Semester', 'Second Semester', 'End of Year'.

Additionally we need to create some associations between students and demographics, in order to make more meaningful the corresponding filters on the reports.

Finally we need to create some assessment records and link those records with some student records.
